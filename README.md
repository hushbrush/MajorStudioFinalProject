Mint Matters: an exploration of the factors that make stamps valuable.

As a child, I loved stamps. Not having yet discovered the power of google, I would tear them off of the envelopes I found them on, and use gum to stick them onto the pages of an old diary. Obviously, that’s a terrible way to collect stamps. Slowly, as my friends and relatives started bringing me the stamps they found, I learnt of their value, their cultural and historical significance. This project aims open the world of philately to new audiences and encourage a deeper appreciation for these miniature artefacts of human history.

To calculate the indices for this project, I started by identifying key factors that influence a stamp’s value, such as condition, rarity, historical context, and printing techniques. Each factor was then quantified based on specific attributes—like the presence of words such as "unused" or "mint" in the description for condition, or terms like "proof plate" for rarity. These individual indices were then weighted and combined to create a composite score that reflects both tangible and cultural aspects of a stamp’s worth. The process aimed to balance objective analysis with the inherent subjectivity of valuing artifacts, making it easier to explore the Smithsonian’s stamp collection through an accessible, data-driven lens.
